Add a protective coating onto your images to discourage downloading. 

== Description ==

This plugin will automatically add a tiny, invisible image on top of all of the images in your site. If a visitor right-clicks on one of your images, they will download the clear tiny image instead of the image that appears.
In no way does the plugin claim to prevent downloads entirely; it is merely an added protective measure for your images.

= Usage =


* Install the plugin through the Install Plugins interface or by uploading the `shrinkwrap_images` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the Shrinkwrap Images plugin.
* That's it! Any image on your site is now coated with a clear, protective layer :)


== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin through the Install Plugins interface or by uploading the `shrinkwrap_images` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the Shrinkwrap Images plugin.
3, That's it! Any image on your site is now coated with a clear, protective layer :)

= Does this plugin prevent image downloads? =

No. It is just a preventative step for image authors who want to do whatever they can to prevent downloads.

At my WordCamp Rochester talk, WordPress for Artists, I was asked if there were any plugins that could do this. Not finding one, I set about writing one myself.
